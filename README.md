# geth-docker-factory

I love the idea behind [Puppeth](https://github.com/immutability-org/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/puppeth), but I would prefer a different implementation: something that uses Terraform to provision infrastructure and a container orchestrator to schedule the Docker images. So, I am going to take puppeth and turn it into a docker-file factory.
